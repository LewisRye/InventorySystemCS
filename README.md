# Inventory Management System by Lewis Rye
This is my first ever project committed to GitHub, it is a project that would aid a small business in adding, removing and editing stock that they hold in their warehouse.

Because this project is still in development, these changes are being considered for the future:
- PayPal Sandbox Integration
- Website Interface
- Realtime Database

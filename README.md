# Inventory Management System by Lewis Rye
## This application will not work without the database being locally hosted to your machine, please contact me if you wish to see the scripts for this.
This project is my first ever project committed to GitHub, it is a project that would aid a small business in adding, removing and editing stock that they hold in their warehouse.

These changes are being considered for the future:
- PayPal Sandbox
- Website for customers
- Realtime database updates

> This project is also using branches to help me learn more about Git.
